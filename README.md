# learning_python_personal

My personal projects outside of learning that I partake out of passion.

My motivation out of these projects necessities my friends/family 
and I may want automated in our day to day lives.

I love the feeling of helping others, and by pursuing these projects from beginning 
to end- I end up helping future self in getting one step closer toward reaching my goal 
of becoming a software developer.

I am open to any and ALL criticism, so please do make any pull requests. I
have a lot to learn and am looking forward to giving back in return.
